CS106A Practice Midterm paper
===

Background
---
This repo forms part of my solutions to the assignments and challenges given to students on Stanford's CS106A Programming Methodology class. I am not a Stanford student but was able to follow the course online using the publicly available resources (see below). For anyone looking to start programming I would thoroughly recommend it as a first step.
